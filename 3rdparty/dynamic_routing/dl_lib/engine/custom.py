class CustomizedTrainer(DIYTrainer):
    """
    A trainer with customized training logic. Compared to `SimpleTrainer`, it
    contains the following logic in addition:

    1. Create model, optimizer, scheduler, dataloader from the given config.
    2. Load a checkpoint or `cfg.MODEL.WEIGHTS`, if exists.
    3. Register a few common hooks.

    It is created to simplify the **standard model training workflow** and reduce code boilerplate
    for users who only need the standard training workflow, with standard features.
    It means this class makes *many assumptions* about your training logic that
    may easily become invalid in a new research. In fact, any assumptions beyond those made in the
    :class:`SimpleTrainer` are too much for research.

    The code of this class has been annotated about restrictive assumptions it mades.
    When they do not work for you, you're encouraged to:

    1. Overwrite methods of this class, OR:
    2. Use :class:`SimpleTrainer`, which only does minimal SGD training and
       nothing else. You can then add your own hooks if needed. OR:
    3. Write your own training loop similar to `tools/plain_train_net.py`.

    Also note that the behavior of this class, like other functions/classes in
    this file, is not stable, since it is meant to represent the "common default behavior".
    It is only guaranteed to work well with the standard models and training workflow in dl_lib.
    To obtain more stable behavior, write your own training logic with other public APIs.
